-I was thinking that we could just have a utitlity function in the driver file that generates random adjacency
  matrices (hence random graphs)

-Im not quite sure what you mean with these comments:
  // I think the scope could be a tad funky here,
  // Since we are in the heap with the storage of the vertex
  // We need to make sure the v is poiting to vertex that is also in the heap
  // Otherwise this will be gross.
